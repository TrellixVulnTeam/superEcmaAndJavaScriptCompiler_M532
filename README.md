super Ecma And JavaScript Compiler
==============================

a super ecmascript to javascript,java, c (via llvm ), csharp, native code-asm, nodejs,v8 and other compiler

WTF ? Yet Another Language ?

At this time, ecmascript latest specification is mature enough to be used as a day-to-day programming language.
Javascript is one of the most used "programming" language in the world and html and css is also mature enough to be used in 
day - to -day  desktop application developement.
(Insipration from)
take a look at Phantom, flex, caja, vala, adobe air, mozilla prism but do not forgot microsoft .htx and .hta old style application,
(yes, the vs studio setup is just an html page with javascript inside !!! ).
take a look at ms wpf ( and also at wcf ;) )
take a look at aptana servers, nodejs and similar tech. Take a look at vaadin, google gwt, zk(framework )
take a look at cosmos and csharp os, at csharp2native code compiler...
take a look at pike, go etc.

It can be a language to rule-them-all ? Standard based ? C | java |csharp like ? 
Yes. I think so. And really is the time...



At this moment the decision to use an ecmascript based language was based on the reality that some legal issues exists with 
( because some patents are approved  restrictind the use ) javascript2nativecode compilation (see future patents).

Our intention is to use an language "extension" of javascript wich is not javascript and create a frontend to llvm to compile that code to native code !!!!

So our final goal is to create
1 dynamic  language
2 but strongly typed 
3 easy to integrate with eclipse
4 and other open source ( directly targeting monodevelop and sharpdevelop )
5 that can be compiled to c ( other language )
6. that can be compiled to native code
7. that can direct load c libraries
8. that can expose libraries to c compilers ( yes , it will be )
9. that can replace perl 
10. that can replace python 
11. that can replace asp svc asmx
12. that can replace haxe, openlaszlo, xaml, as3
13. that can replace php (yes it will !!! )

15. that can be used in dalvik (iphone is not in the  target ... good luck apple )
13. but can be compiled on freebsd and bsd like os a
14. that can be used to write a performant server 
15. because has performant thread library
16. and native cloud and cluster and grid and...  computing
17. that can be easy to integrate with existing web technologyes (dojo, jquery, extjs) and desktop technologyes
18. 14. that can be compiled to 512 boot code 
19. that can be used to write an operating system without nasm gas or 01010001001 knowdlege
19. strong enough to replace bash (like "the force is strooooong in you" - Palpatine -> Anakin )
20. strong enough to be compiled to .class or .il or other vm without much efort
21. strong enough to rewrite libvirt and xen and....
20. strong enough to replace c csharp and java in the future.


etc.

Crazy enough ?
